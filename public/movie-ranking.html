<h1>Best Movies according to Georgi</h1>
<h2>I will list my top 3 movies with short comment why I like them</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>#1. Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>One of the best fantasies ever created.<br>
From the story to the beautiful landscapes</p>

<h3>#2. Dancing with wolves</h3>
<p>Awesome story told by director and actor<br/>
Kevin Costner - really heart touching and very long film</p>

<h3>#3. Spider-man: No Way Home</h3>

<p>I am just a Spider-Man fan, and I loved<br/>
that they brought Tobey, Andrew and Tom together</p>
